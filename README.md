# Market Pressure Analyzer

## Revealing True Market Control Through Statistical Analysis

![Market Analysis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/username/Market-Pressure-Analyzer/main/assets/banner.png)

The Market Pressure Analyzer is a sophisticated analytical tool that provides insight into the underlying forces driving market movements. By examining statistical relationships in price action, the analyzer accurately identifies whether buyers or sellers are in control at any given time.

**A statistically sound approach to market analysis - applicable across all assets and timeframes.**

## Key Capabilities

The Market Pressure Analyzer delivers critical insights that traditional indicators cannot provide:

- **Precise measurement of buying/selling pressure** using robust statistical modeling
- **Statistically validated confidence metrics** for all signals generated
- **Temporal pressure evolution tracking** across multiple timeframes
- **Market regime identification** (bullish, bearish, or neutral distributions)
- **Automated divergence detection** for early identification of potential reversals
- **Universal application** across all asset classes and timeframes

## Methodology

The analyzer employs a proprietary statistical approach that examines normalized price relationships to quantify market pressure:

1. **Statistical Distribution Analysis**: Quantifies the probability of buying or selling control
2. **Temporal Evolution Measurement**: Tracks how pressure develops over time
3. **Regime Comparison**: Identifies the current market structure and regime
4. **Statistical Validation**: Provides confidence intervals and significance testing
5. **Divergence Recognition**: Detects when price and underlying pressure diverge

All analysis is performed locally in your browser with complete data privacy.

## Straightforward Implementation

1. **Export OHLC data** from your preferred platform (CSV format)
2. **Upload** your file to the analyzer
3. **Review the comprehensive analysis** with clear visualizations
4. **Make more informed trading decisions** based on statistical evidence

The analyzer provides a detailed assessment of:

- **Current pressure direction and strength**
- **Statistical confidence in the analysis**
- **Pressure momentum and acceleration**
- **Market regime identification with confidence scoring**
- **Potential divergences between price and pressure**
- **Clear visualization of all key metrics**

## Verification with Example Data

Two example files are included to demonstrate the analyzer's capabilities:

- `5_day_hourly_BTC.csv`: Bitcoin Hourly price data
- `2_day_hourly_NatGas.csv`: Nat Gas Hourly price data

These examples allow immediate testing of the tool's effectiveness across different markets and timeframes.

## The Analytical Framework

The Market Pressure Analyzer is the result of research into market dynamics and statistical validation. The model has been rigorously tested across diverse market conditions to ensure reliability.

The analytical framework examines the statistical relationships in price action to determine current market control with a high degree of accuracy. By focusing on validated statistical principles rather than arbitrary technical indicators, the analyzer provides insights that are both actionable and reliable.

I encourage you to test the analyzer with your own historical data to verify its effectiveness in the markets you trade. The most compelling validation comes from applying these analytical methods to familiar trading environments where you can confirm the results against known outcomes.
